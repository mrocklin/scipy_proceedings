Symbolic Statistics with SymPy
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   We add a random variable type to a mathematical modeling language.

   Symbolics, mathematical modeling, uncertainty, SymPy

Introduction
------------

Mathematical modeling is important. 

Symbolic computer algebra systems are a nice way to simplify the modeling process. 

Uncertainty is important. 

We can add uncertainty to symbolic systems by adding random variables.

Motivating Example
------------------

Consider an artilleryman firing a cannon down into a valley. 

Implementation
--------------



Multi-Compilation
-----------------

We shouldn't make monolithic solutions that encompass several
computational and mathematical disciplines. We should create thin compilers and
clear interface layers. 

This makes current individual solutions slow. 
This enables future growth.
